It is used because it is <em>very easy to convert between Binary and Hexadecimal</em> (much easier than between Binary and Decimal), and short Hex numbers are a lot easier to deal with than long Binary ones. <br>It is based on <em>16 digits</em> (<em>0</em>...<em>9</em>, then <em>A</em>...<em>F</em>). The positions of digits relate to <em>powers of 16</em> (<em>1</em>s, <em>16</em>s, <em>256</em>s, etc.)';
